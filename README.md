## 🚀 1. Project Setup & Demo

### 🔧 Web Application Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zaihl/ai-assisted-knowledge-quiz
    cd plum_ai_knowledge_quiz
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies** (pnpm is recommended)

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project:

    ```bash
    touch .env.local
    ```

    Add your Google Gemini API key to the `.env.local` file:

    ```dotenv
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
    ```

    > **Warning**
    > This file is already in `.gitignore`. **Never commit your API keys** to version control.

4.  **Run the Development Server**

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## 🎯 2. Problem Understanding & Assumptions

The application serves a dual purpose:

1.  A **professional portfolio homepage** that acts as a landing page to showcase development skills and includes a clear call-to-action.
2.  A **feature-rich quiz application** that leverages an AI model to dynamically generate content.

### 📌 User Flow

1.  **Portfolio Homepage (`/`)**: Landing page showcasing the developer, with a CTA to the quiz app.
2.  **Topic Selection (`/quiz`)**: Users can choose a pre-defined topic, enter a custom one, or generate random topics. They can also select the difficulty and number of questions.
3.  **AI Generation Loader (`/quiz/[topic]/loading.tsx`)**: A skeleton UI is displayed while the AI generates the quiz questions.
4.  **Quiz Interface (`/quiz/[topic]`)**: The main interactive screen where users answer questions with real-time feedback.
5.  **Results & Feedback (`/quiz/[topic]/results`)**: A summary screen showing the final score and personalized feedback generated by the AI based on performance.

### 🔑 Assumptions

  - A valid Google Gemini API Key is required and available in the environment variables.
  - The application is designed to be client-side state-managed (using Zustand), requiring no user authentication or database for the core quiz functionality.
  - The primary user flow is linear: Topic Selection → Quiz → Results.

## 🤖 3. AI Prompts & Iterations

### 📚 Quiz Generation (`/api/generateQuiz`)

**Prompt:**

```text
You are an expert quiz creator. Generate a ${questionCount}-question multiple-choice quiz about "${topic}" with a difficulty level of "${difficulty}".
Each question must have 4 options, and only one option can be correct.
Your response MUST be a valid JSON object...
```

### 🎓 Personalized Feedback (`/api/generateFeedback`)

**Prompt:**

```text
You are a friendly and encouraging tutor. The user has just completed a quiz.
Their topic was: "${topic}"...
Provide personalized feedback (2–3 paragraphs). Do not respond in JSON.
```

### 🎲 Random Topics (`/api/randomTopics`)

**Prompt:**

```text
You are a creative assistant. Generate an array of 5 unique and engaging topics...
Return ONLY valid JSON.
```

## ⚠️ 6. Known Issues & Potential Improvements

  - **Error Handling**: Currently minimal. Could be improved by adding toast notifications (e.g., using `sonner`) for API errors or invalid user inputs.
  - **AI Response Validation**: Implement robust schema validation (e.g., using `Zod`) on the server-side to ensure the AI's JSON output is always correctly structured before sending it to the client.
  - **State Persistence**: User's progress in a quiz is lost on page refresh. This could be solved by using `zustand/middleware/persist` to save the quiz state to `localStorage`.
  - **User Accounts**: For a more personalized experience, user authentication (e.g., NextAuth.js) and a database (e.g., Supabase/Postgres) could be added to save quiz history and track performance over time.
